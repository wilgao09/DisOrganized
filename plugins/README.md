# Plugins

## What is this

This is a development area, but does not hold the plugins that will be loaded. Plugins are loaded from `$HOME` (or `%HOMEPATH%`). This directory simply provides the typescript type file that the plugin should adhere to. After compile your typescript plugin file, copy and paste it into `$HOME/DisOrganized/plugins`.
